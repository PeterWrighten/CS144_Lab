# Notes

## [Lab 0: Networking Warmup](https://cs144.github.io/assignments/lab0.pdf)

* • The lab documents aren’t “specifications”—meaning they’re not intended to be consumed in a one-way fashion. They’re written closer to the level of detail that a software engineer will get from a boss or client. We expect that you’ll benefit from attending the lab sessions and asking clarifying questions if you find something to be ambiguous and you think the answer matters. (If you think something might not be fully specified, sometimes the truth is that it doesn’t matter—you could try one approach or the other and see what happens.)
